                <li>What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</li>
                <li>How can you adapt an existing solution to address a new or unforeseen challenge?</li>
                <li>What strategies do you use to identify patterns or structures in complex datasets?</li>
                <li>How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over-optimization in a solution?</li>
                <li>Reflect on breaking down a problem into smaller components.</li>
                <li>What trade-offs do you consider when choosing different approaches to solve a problem?</li>
